In the meantime, the system works like this: If a member from one faction kills the member of another faction, that faction can declare war and a war will start, however, there are some circumstances where this is not valid. One of which is if one faction is raiding another faction. If a faction member who was raiding gets killed and an act of war is generated, it is not valid and must be deleted. In addition: There is no NLR in war.

						                                              You cannot build a base that is made to be unraidable. What constitutes as unraidable is anything that is designed to create "fish in a barrel" sort of scenarios. This means that your base can never be designed so that someone inside of the base can hurt someone who is attempting to pick a lock/crack a keypad. You are also not allowed to create tight hallways for your base. Your base entrance must allow two people walking next to each other to enter at once.

<div style="text-align:left"><span style="text-align:left;line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent"><font color="#6aa84f">You cannot kill people for insulting you, or if you perceive it as an insult. The only time you can kill someone for insulting you is if they flat out call you offensive names and don't let up on it. If they call you a simple name or say something offensive and walk off, that is not a reason to kill. If they persist, like following you around, consistently dropping one liners and running off,  or continue to constantly talk about you in public places, tell an admin. If they are doing it in your base, and they refuse to leave, you can kill. If someone is blatantly disregarding this rule and consistently acts like an asshole or a smart ass in small ways, or again, they drop small one liners and run off over and over (aka they know this rule exists and they are trying to tip toe around it), they can be killed.</font></span></div>

With this tool you can build any character you want, but like with bases try and keep it reasonable. Please do not use trails or sun beams. Exploiting PAC in any way, which includes but is not limited to making yourself invisible, giant or adding giant props will result in an instant unwarned kick. Repeated offense will result in a ban. Please refrain from using models from custom addons off the workshop. If someone else does not have the content, they will see a huge flashing error. if you see other's with custom models, they have taken extra steps to make that possible.

This can be done by putting "//" before a message. Any content that is discussed in OOC which pertains to roleplay or is for the use of an advantage over other players, is considered metagaming and is not allowed. Please use discretion when using OOC, and take care not to flood the chat. If you need to report something to an admin, please do not use OOC. Please start a message with a "@" instead of "//". Only admins can see this and it is a lot more noticeable. You could be ignored if you do not do this.
